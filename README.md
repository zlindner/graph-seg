# graph-seg

> Unsupervised text segmentation using semantic relatedness graphs

An implementation of the unsupervised text segmentation algorithm proposed by [Glavas, Nanni, & Ponzetto (2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S16-2016.pdf). The original implementation in Java can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/gg42554/graphseg/src/master/).
